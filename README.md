Bioinformatics tools for genome analysis

**ABOUT**

This is a collection of mostly organized Perl scripts for working with genomics data. There is no install or build process, just use them in place. See below for usage information.

**INSTALLATION**

All scripts require Perl version 5.10 and some use non-core Perl modules. Though, there are no dependencies that cannot be installed from CPAN. To get the scripts, simply download the zip version of the repo, or use git:

    git clone https://github.com/sestaton/sesbio.git

After that, you can use the scripts in place and run `git pull` in the base directory to keep things up to date. Send me a message or file an issue if you have feature requests or run into any issues.

**USAGE**

Most scripts have at least minimal documentation that can be accessed by typing the name of the script and reading the menu. Some scripts are well tested and have formal documentation that can be accessed by specifying the manual option (e.g., `perl script.pl --man`). Though, a lot of the scripts were written for one time use so not a lot of work was put into documenting or polishing the code. If something looks useful but is unclear, just ask, I should be able to help.
