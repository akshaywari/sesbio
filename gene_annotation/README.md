A collection of gene annotation and fasta/q-handling scripts


**OVERVIEW**

Every script contains documentation or at least some minimal usage information. To find out the usage of a particular script just type "perl" followed by the script name. For example,

    perl hmm2go.pl

**INSTALLATION**

All scripts require Perl version 5.10 and some use non-core Perl modules. Though, there are no dependencies that cannot be installed from CPAN.
